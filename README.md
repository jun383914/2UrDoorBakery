## Why am I doing this project?
I always want to use what I learned to benefit my community. Learning ASP.Net at Microsoft Software and System Academy allows me to develop a lightweight application on my own. I love trying out different baking receipt in my spare time and I've received some positive feedbacks from my friends and family, so I came up with this idea to allow people in my community to shop my little bakery.
